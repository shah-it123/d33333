D3 is a Javascript library
    A core library  
    With many satellite libraries
    Referemced via a CDN (Content Delivery Network)
D3 generates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics is an Extensible Markup Language (XML))
    Once generated, that SVG is entirely detachable from D3
SVG is a vector format
    with wide, deep,  and old support
    In all major browsers
We can draw graphics primitives with SVG
    Text
    Circles
    Rectangles
We can represent data with SVG primitives   
    With circles using radius
        Or, the square root of radius to preserve proportionality
    Height or width on rectangles
We can perform transformations on SVG elements
    Like Scale and Rotate
    Transforms are performed from transform origin
        Which is, by default, the center of the canvas
        We can take control of it
            With the transform-origin attribute
